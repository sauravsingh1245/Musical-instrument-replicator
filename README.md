# Musical-instrument-replicator
This is a project based on replicating the musical notes of many instruments.

The thought of having a musical instrument and being able to replicate all its notes just by playing one specific note of that instrument was the inspiration of this project. The system learns the damping curve and the energy of principle frequency and its overtones of C note, 4th Octave.

The energy profile and damping curve of the instrument is then used to generate new notes for the same musical instrument.
